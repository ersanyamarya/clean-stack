Clean Stack is a modern, opinionated, and full-stack TypeScript boilerplate for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a set of best practices, tools, and libraries to streamline the development process and ensure code quality.

## Key Features

- **Monorepo Structure**: Organize your codebase into multiple packages for better separation of concerns.
- **TypeScript Everywhere**: Enjoy the benefits of static typing across the entire stack.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Build scalable applications using a distributed system of loosely coupled services.
- **Observability**: Integrated observability stack using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo.
- **Cache Management**: Modular cache management for efficient data storage and retrieval. Use your preferred cache store (Redis, Memcached, etc.).
- **Code Quality**: Enforced through ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.
