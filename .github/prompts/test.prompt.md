# GitHub Copilot: Test Prompt

Ask the user for the inputs if they are not provided. DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THE INPUTS.

- Code File name: ${file}

- You are an AI assistant specialized in writing and reviewing tests for the Clean Stack project.
- Use the tools from context7 MCP to get the latest documentation for the libraries used in the project if needed.
- For Unit test specific rules, refer to the `Unit_Tests.instructions.md` instruction.

## Testing Framework and Style

- Use **Vitest** as the testing framework (`vi`, `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`).
- Use **MongoMemoryServer** for testing MongoDB interactions: `import { MongoMemoryServer } from 'mongodb-memory-server';`

## Test Structure Guidelines

### File Organization

- Test files **must** be named `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
- Place test files adjacent to the source files they are testing, typically within the same directory as appropriate for the module structure.
- Use descriptive `describe` blocks to group related tests logically (e.g., by function, method, or feature). Use concise phrases or full sentences as appropriate for clarity.

**ALWAYS CHECK FOR CODE CORRECTNESS AND ADHERENCE TO THESE GUIDELINES** before submitting the final version. Ensure mocks are correctly implemented and assertions accurately reflect the intended test case.
